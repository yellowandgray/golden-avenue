                                <p>Network security is any activity designed to protect the usability and integrity of your network and data. It includes both hardware and software technologies. Effective network security manages access to the network. It targets a variety of threats and stops them from entering or spreading on your network.</p> 
                                <p>Relentless cyber criminals, disgruntled current and former employees and careless users can bring down your computer networks and compromise data. Network security’s made up of the hardware, software, policies and procedures designed to defend against both internal and external threats to your company’s computer systems. Multiple layers of hardware and software can prevent threats from damaging computer networks, and stop them from spreading if they slip past your defenses.</p>

                            <p class="text-center">These network security fundamentals are vital to downtime prevention, government regulation compliance, reduced liability and reputation protection:</p>
                            <h3>Make patches and updates current</h3>
                            <p class="text-justify">GOLDEN AVENUE keeps an inventory to make sure each device is updated regularly, including mobile devices and network hardware. And make sure Windows and Apple computers have automatic updating enabled.</p>
                            <h3>Ensure Use strong passwords</h3>
                            <p class="text-justify">A strong password is one that’s difficult to detect by humans and computers, is at least 6 characters, preferably more, and uses a combination of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers and symbols. GOLDEN AVENUE ensures that this standard is followed by employees throughout the business</p>
                            <h3>Make Certain your VPN is secure</h3>
                            <p class="text-justify">Any open network connection is a vulnerability hackers can exploit to sneak in to your network. Moreover, data on the whole is vulnerable while it is traveling over the Internet. GOLDEN AVENUE reviews and make sure that the strongest possible protocols for encryption and verification are in use.</p>
                            <h3>Aggressively manage user access privileges</h3>
                            <p class="text-justify">Inappropriate user-access privileges pose a significant security threat. Managing employee access to critical data on an ongoing basis should not be overlooked. Many employees have access to “sensitive, confidential data outside the scope of their job requirements. General business data such as documents, spreadsheets, emails and other sources of unstructured data are most at risk for snooping, followed by customer data. When an employee’s job changes, GOLDEN AVENUE ensures that their access privileges can be modified to fit the duties of the new position.</p>
                            <h3>Clean up inactive accounts</h3>
                            <p class="text-justify">Hackers use inactive accounts once assigned to contractors and former employees to gain access and disguise their activity.</p>
