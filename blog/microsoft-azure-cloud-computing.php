                            <h4><b>Microsoft Azure in a nutshell</b></h4>
                            <p>Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing service created for building, testing, deploying, and managing applications and services through Microsoft-managed data centres. It delivers software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and supports many different programming languages, tools and frameworks, including both Microsoft-specific and third-party software and systems. Azure is available worldwide and can be used to host websites, apps, virtual machines and databases.</p>
                            <h4><b>How can it be beneficial to you?</b></h4>
                            <p>This is yet another cloud computing software designed to help companies that rid themselves of the liabilities imposed by traditional and expensive software. There is no need to invest in expensive servers or a hoard of engineers on hand to keep it going. Let Microsoft do the job for you.</p>
                            <p>Whatever the type of application you want to build, you must have a basic platform in place. This includes an operating system that needs to be patched and updated to current standards, the network and routers, storage of your data. The platform must be scalable in order to support all the customers worldwide. If you are a start-up or a business with limited funds, you don’t want to pay for such capacity up front. Also, you don’t want to worry about hiring people to look after servers, network appliances, software updates and backup.</p>
                            <p>MS Azure allows you to rent a data platform and pay for it as you go, just like you do for utilities like water or electricity. It’s called utility computing because you only pay for what you use.</p>
                            <h4><b>The benefits to business </b></h4>
                            <p>A cloud computing platform service like Windows Azure can provide companies with several benefits.</p>
                            <p><em>Cost reduction</em>– Since it’s a pay as you go service model, it reduces the upfront costs. </p>
                            <p><em>Scalability increase</em>– As your customers grows and the usage of your application grows you can add additional capacity to make sure your application is running smoothly. No worries on running out of server capacity.</p>
                            <p><em>Added flexibility</em>–Applications can be deployed to the Windows Azure platform very quickly which means that any changes can be applied without any downtime. This makes it an ideal platform for developers to add functionality to your application that you would otherwise not implement.</p>
                            <p><em>Quicker time to market</em>–Since there is no infrastructure or platform, you can focus on developing the core functionality of your business application so it can be completed quicker, thus reducing your time to market.</p>
