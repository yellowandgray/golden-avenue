                            <p class="text-justify">Most cyber-attacks happen because of an internal blunder.</p>
                            <p class="text-justify">The biggest benefit to holding a session on security awareness is to build better security from within. Knowing your employees are prepared and acting with a focus on data security gives you unmatched peace of mind and the confidence that your business is doing everything possible to prevent data breaches and possible external attacks.</p>

                                <h3 class="color-blue">Why is Cyber Security Awareness Training so important to your Organization?</h3>
                                <p>Cyber Security awareness training is about teaching employees to understand the risks and threats around the ever-evolving digital world. It also ensures that employees are fully conscious to the consequences of failing to protect the organization from external attackers. Data breaches are a major concern for all. Learning how to prevent security occurrences should be an essential part of an employee’s job.</p>

                                    <h4>You are less likely to be penetrated or breached from outside</h4>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Training your staff to spot the signs of an attack means they’re less likely to fall victim. Your employees can be a shield in protecting your organization from other vulnerabilities.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">For instance, phishing scams target individuals indiscriminately. Anyone can receive a malicious email, social media message or text that asks the recipient to hand over their login details. So, it’s vital that employees are shown how to stay one step ahead of criminals.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Cyber security awareness training can also preclude accidental breaches. Employees are always likely to mishandle sensitive information like losing devices and misconfiguring databases which are some of the common concerns, but reminding them of their security obligations can mitigate the risk.</p>

                                    <h4>You are able to meet regulatory requirements</h4>
                                    <p>Cyber security is being addressed at government-level now more than ever before, with several new regulations mandating strengthened security controls. Employee cyber security awareness trainings are almost universally essential to avoid any disciplinary action.</p>

                                    <h4 class="wow fadeInLeft">You can improve company culture</h4>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Employees often find cyber security trainings frustrating and boring. The reason being, no one articulates to them as to what they should do or who they should speak to if such a breach occurs. Reprimanding or disciplining them without giving them proper training is not appropriate.</p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Cyber security awareness training gives employees the knowledge and confidence to handle their cyber security responsibilities. They are less likely to feel stranded, because they would have been trained.</p>
