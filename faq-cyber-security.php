                                <ul>
                                    <li>Security awareness training is about teaching employees to understand the risks and threats around the ever evolving digital world. Security awareness training ensures that employees are fully conscious to the consequences of failing to protect the organization from external attackers.</li>  
                                </ul>
                                <h3  class="color-blue">Why is a cyber security program important?</h3>

                                    <li>Do you give cyber security training to a new employee?</li>
                                    <li>Data breaches are a major concern for all. Learning how to prevent security occurrences should be an essential part of an employees’ job.</li>

                                <h4>1. You are less likely to be penetrated or breached from outside</h4>
                                <p>Training your staff to spot the signs of an attack means they’re less likely to fall victim. Your employees can be crucial in protecting your organisation from other vulnerabilities.</p>
                                <p>For instance, phishing scams target individuals indiscriminately. Anyone can receive a malicious email, social media message or text that asks the recipient to hand over their login details. Phishing and other types of social engineering and media can be tricky to spot, and technological defences are unreliable. So it’s vital that employees are shown how to stay one step ahead of criminals.</p>
                                <p>Cyber security awareness training can also preclude accidental breaches. Employees are always likely to mishandle sensitive information like losing devices and mis-configuring databases which are some of the common concerns, but reminding them of their security obligations can mitigate the risk.</p>

                                <h4>2. It helps you meet regulatory requirements</h4>
                                <p  class="text-justify">Cyber security is being addressed at government-level more than ever, with several new regulations mandating strengthened security controls. Employee cyber awareness trainings are almost universally essential to avoid any disciplinary action.</p>

                                <h4>3. It improves company culture</h4>
                                <p>Employees often find cyber security frustrating. The reason being, no one articulates to them as to what they should do or who they should speak to if such a breach occurs. Reprimanding or disciplining them without giving them proper training is not appropriate.</p>
                                <p>Cyber security awareness training gives employees the knowledge and confidence to handle their cyber security responsibilities. They are less likely to feel stranded, because they would have been trained.</p>

                                    <li>The main goal of this workshop is to EDUCATE AND TRAIN your Employees on the hassles of being complacent to the threats lingering out there. Most cyber-attacks happen because of an internal blunder. Educating your employees on cyber security is the best way to protect your organization from many external cyber-attacks.</li>
                                    <li>The solution includes Interactive, web-based cyber security training, Executive reporting to ensure attendance and compliance, webinars, checklists and other expert content</li>
                                    <li>The primary objective of a security awareness program is to educate users on their responsibility to help protect their organization's information assets.</li>
